# MkDocs

This repository contains starter files for a python mkdocs project dependent on the [titanlib](https://dev.azure.com/RNDPLAT/TitanLib)
repository.

[mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is an extensible static site generator, that uses markdown sourcefiles 
and a yaml configuration file to build code documentation.

This project guides the reader through setup and basic usage of mkdocs for the purpose 
of compiling python docstrings into hostable documentation.

## `Installations`
To get the most from mkdocs we will install 2 packages, 
[mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/python/#preview)

```bash
    pip install mkdocs
    pip install mkdocstrings-python
```

## `Docstring formatting`
This document uses [google style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
docstrings and they will be used in the examples.

## `Examples`

The examples contained in this repository are meant to serve as a simple showcase for how mkdocs works.
They also show how to use the titanlib and serve as a simple tutorial for users of that library.
